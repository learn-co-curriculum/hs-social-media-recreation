## Building A Social Media Clone

Many of your favorite social media applications follow similar patterns. Over the next several classes, you'll be working in groups to build your own social media clone using Fwitter as a guide. Choose an app that allows users to post content. Some examples:

+ Instagram
+ Snapchat
+ Tumblr
+ Blogspot
+ Yik Yak
+ Pinterest

For now, focus on just the posting feature. For example, if you're building Instagram, don't worry about image uploading, just store a link as part of the Photo model. With Snapchat, don't worry about making the Snaps expire or sending to other users yet, just make it function more similarly to Instagram. 

## Today's Goal

By the end of today's class, your goal is to:

1. Create a Github repository and add your teammates as collaborators. 
2. Build out your Sinatra File structure (use Fwitter as a Guide)
3. Create a Model to represent your content. It should have at least two attributes, one being username. 
4. Create an `index.erb` page to display all of the created content. 
5. Add a form for people to add new content. 
6. Setup your controller with the necessary routes.
